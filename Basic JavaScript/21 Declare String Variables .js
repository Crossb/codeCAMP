/*

 Declare String Variables
 Previously we have used the code

 var myName = "your name";

 "your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

 Instructions
 Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

 myFirstName should be a string with at least one character in it.
 myLastName should be a string with at least one character in it.

  ____________Execution



// Example
var firstName = "Alan";
var lastName = "Turing";

// Only change code below this line

myFirstName = "YAroslav";
myLastName = "Shevchuk";
