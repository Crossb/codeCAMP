/*
 Constructing Strings with Variables
 Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

 Instructions
 Set myName to a string equal to your name and build myStr with myName between the strings "My name is " and " and I am swell!"


 myName should be set to a string at least 3 characters long
 Use two + operators to build myStr with myName inside it

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "Free Code Camp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "Some thing Great!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
